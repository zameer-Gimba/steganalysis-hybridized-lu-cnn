# steganalysis-hybridized-lu-cnn
This project explores a dynamic hybridization of LU-based activation functions (ELU, ReLU, and LeakyReLU) within a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for Steganalysis.  The work was developed during my SIWES (Industrial Training) at  NITDA ICT Hub, Federal University Kashere (FUK), Gombe State.
